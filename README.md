# Leetcode-Solutions
Welcome to my Leetcode-Solutions repository!

This project is where I store , organize , and share my solutions to various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The main goal is to practice algorithmic thinking, improve coding skills, and build a useful reference for myself and others.

## Program Languages Used 🛠️
- **C++** : Because it's high performance , flexibility , and popular in algorithm competitions.
- **Kotlin** : I aspire to become app developer in future , so I choose **Kotlin** to practice and improve

## 📂 Project Structure
```
Leetcode-Solutions/
│
├── C++_Solution/
│   └── ... (C++ source files: .cpp, .h)
│
├── Kotlin_Solution/
│   └── ... (Kotlin source files: .kt)
│
└── README.md
```
- All C++ solutions are in the `C++_Solution` folder
- All Kotlin solutions are in the `Kotlin_Solution` folder
- Each file is usually named in the order `Leetcode - Problem Number - Difficulty` so that you can find it easily on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## 🧑‍💻How to Use
- Browse the folder to find solutions by language
- Each file contains sample code , issue summary , testcases , and brief comments for you
- Additionally , Time Complexity is included for most solutions
- You can copy , adapt , run the code for your own learning.

## 🎯Goals
- Improve coding skills
- Practice classic and advanced algorithm
- Build a strong technical foundation

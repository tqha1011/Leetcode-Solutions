/* 
    Problem: 141. Linked List Cycle (Easy)
    Given the head of a linked list, determine whether it contains a cycle.

    A cycle exists if a node in the list can be reached again 
    by continuously following the next pointer.
*/

/*
    Technique: Two Pointers or Hash Set
    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list
    Space Complexity: O(n) â€” for storing visited nodes

    Idea: 
    - Traverse the linked list while storing the address of each visited node in a set.
    - If we encounter a node whose address is already in the set, we return true (cycle detected).
